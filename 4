It looks like you're running into a ConfigurationError: LifecycleConfig execution failed with non zero exit code 127. This error, specifically exit code 127, typically means that a command specified in your script was not found or could not be executed.

In your backup.sh script, you're using the rsync command. The SageMaker Studio Lifecycle Configuration environment might not have rsync pre-installed by default.

To fix this, you need to ensure rsync is installed within your Lifecycle Configuration script before you attempt to use it. You can do this by adding an apt-get update and apt-get install rsync command at the beginning of your script.

Here's the updated backup.sh script and the steps to implement it:
Updated SageMaker Lifecycle Configuration Backup Script
24 Jul, 01:46

Open



#!/bin/bash

set -eux

# Update package lists and install rsync
# This is crucial because rsync might not be pre-installed in the LCC environment.
echo "Updating package lists and installing rsync..."
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y rsync

echo "Current working directory: ${PWD}"
echo "SageMaker Space Name: ${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME}"

# Find the EFS ID. This assumes the EFS is mounted under custom-file-systems/efs/
# and its ID is the directory name.
efs_id=$(ls ./custom-file-systems/efs/ | grep "fs-" | tail -n 1)
echo "Detected EFS ID: ${efs_id}"

# Get current timestamp for backup directory naming
time_now=$(date +%s)
echo "Current timestamp: ${time_now}"

# Print environment variables to a log file for debugging
printenv > env.log

# Create the backup directory structure on EFS
# The path is custom-file-systems/efs/<EFS_ID>/space_ebs_backup/<SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME>/
backup_dir="custom-file-systems/efs/${efs_id}/space_ebs_backup/${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME}"
echo "Creating backup directory: ${backup_dir}"
mkdir -p "${backup_dir}"

# Perform the rsync operation
# -a: archive mode (preserves permissions, ownership, timestamps, etc.)
# --ignore-existing: skip updating files that already exist on the destination
# --exclude custom-file-systems: prevent rsyncing the mounted EFS back into itself
# The source is the current directory (which is the EBS volume content)
# The destination is the EFS backup directory
echo "Starting rsync backup..."
rsync -a --ignore-existing --exclude custom-file-systems/ ./ "${backup_dir}/"

echo "Rsync backup completed successfully."





Here's how to implement and validate this:

1. Update/Create the SageMaker Lifecycle Configuration
Go to SageMaker Studio: Open your Amazon SageMaker Studio console.

Navigate to Lifecycle Configurations: In the left navigation pane, choose Admin configurations, then Lifecycle configurations.

Create or Update:

If you're creating a new LCC: Click Create configuration.

If you're updating an existing LCC: Select your existing LCC (e.g., "7" from your error message), then click Edit.

Configure Script:

Give your LCC a descriptive name (e.g., EBS-EFS-Backup-LCC).

Select JupyterLab for the "Lifecycle config for" option.

Copy the entire updated script provided above into the "Script content" area.

Create/Save: Click Create configuration or Save changes.

2. Attach the Lifecycle Configuration to your SageMaker User Profile
Go to User Profiles: In the left navigation pane, choose Admin configurations, then User profiles.

Select your User Profile: Click on the user profile you want to attach the LCC to.

Edit User Profile: Click Edit.

Add Lifecycle Configuration:

Scroll down to the "JupyterLab settings" section.

Under "Default lifecycle configuration", select the LCC you just created/updated (e.g., EBS-EFS-Backup-LCC).

You can also add it to "Additional lifecycle configurations" if you want to allow users to choose it when launching JupyterLab.

Submit: Click Submit.

3. Validate the Lifecycle Configuration
Launch JupyterLab: From your SageMaker Studio console, launch JupyterLab for the user profile where you attached the LCC.

Monitor LCC Execution:

When JupyterLab starts, the LCC script will execute.

You can monitor the execution status and logs by going to Admin configurations > Lifecycle configurations, selecting your LCC, and then viewing the Execution history tab. Look for the recent execution for your user profile.

The logs should show the output of the apt-get commands, rsync output, and any echo statements from your script.

Verify Backup on EFS:

Once JupyterLab has launched, you can open a terminal within JupyterLab.

Navigate to the mounted EFS directory: cd custom-file-systems/efs/<your_efs_id>/space_ebs_backup/<your_sagemaker_space_name>/

List the contents: ls -la

You should see the files and directories from your SageMaker EBS volume (excluding custom-file-systems) replicated here.

By adding sudo apt-get update -y and sudo apt-get install -y rsync, you ensure that the rsync command is available in the environment where your Lifecycle Configuration script runs, which should resolve the "command not found" error (exit code 127).
