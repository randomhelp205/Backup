Great questions—let’s unpack your script, review **why it’s not working** in SageMaker Lifecycle Config (LCC), and clarify the **prerequisites** for a robust SageMaker-EFS backup LCC.

## 1. What Your Script Does (And Doesn’t Do)

Your script:
- **Tries** to find an EFS filesystem ID by listing files in `./custom-file-systems/efs/` (this path is **unlikely to exist** on a fresh SageMaker JupyterLab/Notebook instance).
- **Creates** a subdirectory on what it thinks is EFS (e.g., `custom-file-systems/efs/${efs_id}/space_ebs_backup/${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME}`).
- **Attempts** to `rsync` your entire workspace (excluding `custom-file-systems`) to the supposed EFS path.

## 2. **Critical Issues & Root Causes**

### **A. `custom-file-systems/efs/` Does Not Exist**
- **Default error:** `ls: cannot access './custom-file-systems/efs/': No such file or directory`
- **Effect:** Your script fails at the first `efs_id=...` line, and `mkdir`/`rsync` will also fail.
- **Why:** SageMaker JupyterLab/Notebook instances **do not** automatically have access to EFS. EFS **must be explicitly created, mounted, and working** before your LCC runs.

### **B. No EFS Mount**
- **EFS is not a directory inside `custom-file-systems`**—it is a **network filesystem service**.
- **You must mount EFS** (e.g., at `/mnt/efs`) and ensure it is accessible and writable by the SageMaker instance.
- **There is no built-in “EFS discovery”** or “EFS listing” in SageMaker. You must **know your EFS ID** and **have already mounted it** somewhere in the instance.

### **C. Directory Structure**
- The directories you are trying to create (`custom-file-systems/efs/...`) **do not exist** and **cannot be created** unless EFS is already mounted.
- `rsync` and `mkdir -p` will **fail** if the parent directory (EFS mount point) does not exist.

## 3. **SageMaker LCC Prerequisites for EFS Backup**

### **A. EFS Must Be Mounted Before LCC Runs**
- **EFS must be attached to your VPC** and **security groups** must allow access.
- **Mount EFS** at instance launch, e.g., by **user data** or **instance profile automation**. This is **not automatic**—you must arrange this **before** your LCC script runs.
- **Example:** If you mount EFS at `/mnt/efs`, then your backup target should be `/mnt/efs/space_ebs_backup/${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME}`.

### **B. EFS Filesystem ID Must Be Known**
- **You must know your EFS ID** (e.g., `fs-12345678`).
- **Do not try to “discover” it at runtime**—pass it as an environment variable or hardcode it if safe.

### **C. The SageMaker Instance Must Have IAM Permissions**
- The **instance role** must have permissions to access EFS.
- Attach **AmazonEFSFullAccess** (or a custom policy) to your SageMaker Studio domain or Notebook instance role.

### **D. Environment Variables**
- `SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME` is **only available in SageMaker Studio (not Studio Classic or Notebook instances)**. If you use this in a Notebook Instance LCC, it will **not be defined**.
- **This variable is not set by default** in all SageMaker environments. If you use it, **be sure it is passed or set**.

### **E. No Additional Packages?**
- **`rsync` is included** in SageMaker’s standard Amazon Linux image.
- **No extra Python or OS packages** are needed for basic `rsync` operation (but you do need the above infrastructure setup).

## 4. **Corrected Minimal Script Example**

Assume **EFS is mounted at `/mnt/efs`** and **your EFS ID is `fs-12345678`** (replace with yours):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -eux

# Exit if EFS is not mounted (critical)
if ! mountpoint -q /mnt/efs; then
  echo "EFS is not mounted at /mnt/efs!" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Replace with your actual EFS ID or pass as env var
EFS_ID="fs-12345678"

# ${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME} is only in Studio, not Notebook Instances
# If unset, use a default or exit
SPACE_NAME=${SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME:-"default"}

# Define backup root on EFS
BACKUP_ROOT="/mnt/efs/space_ebs_backup/${EFS_ID}/${SPACE_NAME}"

# Create backup dir (mkdir -p ignores if exists)
mkdir -p "${BACKUP_ROOT}"

# rsync current dir (excluding any custom directories), no trailing slash
rsync -a --ignore-existing --exclude=.ipynb_checkpoints --exclude=custom-file-systems ./ "${BACKUP_ROOT}/"
```

## 5. **How to Debug – Step by Step**

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**:  
   Logs will tell you **exactly where** the script fails (e.g., “No such file or directory”, “Permission denied”, etc.).
2. **Test EFS Mount Manually**:  
   Launch a SageMaker terminal and check if `/mnt/efs` exists and is writable.  
   ```sh
   ls /mnt/efs
   touch /mnt/efs/testfile
   ```
3. **Check `rsync`**:  
   Run `rsync --version` in the terminal to confirm it’s present.
4. **Check `SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME`**:  
   Run `printenv | grep SAGEMAKER`—if it’s not set, your script must handle that.
5. **Simplify Further**:  
   Start with a script that just writes a file to `/mnt/efs`—confirm that works before adding `rsync`.

| Prerequisite                | How to Check/Set                                  | Notes                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| EFS mounted at known path   | `mountpoint -q /mnt/efs` returns 0                | Must be done **before** LCC runs              |
| EFS ID known                | Pass as env var, or hardcode                      | Do **not** try to discover dynamically        |
| IAM permissions             | Attach `AmazonEFSFullAccess` to instance role      | Required for EFS access                       |
| `SAGEMAKER_SPACE_NAME` set  | `printenv | grep SAGEMAKER`                   | Only in SageMaker Studio, not Notebook        |
| `rsync` available           | `rsync --version`                                 | Standard in Amazon Linux                      |

## **7. Next Steps**

- **Mount EFS at launch** using user data or instance profile automation.
- **Hardcode your EFS ID** (or pass it as an env var if you have automation).
- **Test EFS access interactively** in a Jupyter terminal.
- **Update your LCC script** to target the **real EFS mount point** (e.g., `/mnt/efs`).
- **Check CloudWatch logs** after each change—they will clearly tell you why the script failed.
- **Gradually add complexity**: Once you can write a file to `/mnt/efs`, then add `rsync` logic.
