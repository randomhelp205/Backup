As a cloud developer, implementing an automated process to back up SageMaker user EBS volumes to a mounted EFS directory for disaster recovery is a critical task. The issue you're encountering, where your Lifecycle Configuration (LCC) script works for a "hello world" but fails with the AWS-provided backup.sh script, typically points to a timeout or resource contention problem during the SageMaker instance's startup.

The SIGTERM error in your CloudWatch logs indicates that the JupyterLab server process is being terminated. This often happens because the LCC script is taking too long to execute, exceeding the allowed startup time for the SageMaker instance, or it's causing a conflict that prevents the server from initializing correctly. The "hello world" script finishes almost instantly, while the rsync operation in the backup.sh script can take a significant amount of time depending on the size and number of files in the user's EBS volume.

Below, I'll guide you through setting up the LCC, starting with a basic "hello world" to confirm the setup, and then provide an enhanced version of the backup.sh script with improved logging and error handling to help diagnose the exact point of failure or timeout.

1. Setting up the SageMaker Lifecycle Configuration (LCC)
First, let's ensure you have the basic LCC creation and attachment process correct.

1.1. Create the Lifecycle Configuration Script (Hello World)

This script will simply write a message to a log file, confirming the LCC executes.

Steps to Create LCC in AWS Console:

Navigate to SageMaker: Go to the AWS Management Console, search for "SageMaker," and open the service.

Lifecycle Configurations: In the left navigation pane, under Admin configurations, choose Lifecycle configurations.

Create Lifecycle Configuration: Click the Create lifecycle configuration button.

Name: Give your LCC a descriptive name, e.g., sagemaker-user-profile-backup-lcc.

Script Content:

For Script type, choose JupyterLab.

For Script content, paste the "Hello World LCC Script" provided above.

Submit: Click Create lifecycle configuration.

1.2. Attach the LCC to a SageMaker User Profile

Navigate to User Profiles: In the left navigation pane, under Admin configurations, choose User profiles.

Select User Profile: Select the user profile you want to attach the LCC to (or create a new one).

Edit User Profile: Click the Edit button.

Lifecycle Configuration: Scroll down to the Lifecycle configuration section.

Add Configuration: Under JupyterLab, click Add configuration.

Select LCC: Choose the LCC you just created (e.g., sagemaker-user-profile-backup-lcc).

Submit: Click Submit.

1.3. Test the "Hello World" LCC

Launch JupyterLab: From the SageMaker console, go to User profiles, select the user profile, and click Open JupyterLab.

Monitor CloudWatch Logs:

Go to the AWS Management Console, search for "CloudWatch," and open the service.

In the left navigation pane, choose Log groups.

Search for a log group named /aws/sagemaker/studio. You'll find log streams related to your domain and user profile (e.g., domain-id/user-profile-name/jupyterlab).

Look for the output of your "Hello World" script. If you see the "Hello from SageMaker Lifecycle Configuration!" message, the LCC is correctly configured and executing.

2. Implementing the EBS to EFS Backup LCC Script
Now that you've confirmed the basic LCC setup, let's address the backup.sh script. The SIGTERM error indicates that the script is likely taking too long or encountering an issue that prevents the JupyterLab server from starting.

The following script is an enhanced version of the AWS-provided one, with additional logging, explicit checks for the EFS mount, and error handling. This will help you pinpoint the exact cause of the failure in your CloudWatch logs.

Key Enhancements in the Script:

Dedicated Log File: Output is redirected to /var/log/sagemaker/lifecycle-config-ebs-efs-backup.log in addition to CloudWatch, making it easier to debug directly on the instance if needed.

Explicit EFS Mount Checks: The script now verifies that the custom-file-systems/efs/ path exists and that an EFS ID directory (fs-) can be found within it. This helps confirm that the EFS is correctly mounted and accessible.

Robust Directory Creation: mkdir -p is used, and its success is explicitly checked.

Detailed Logging: More echo statements are added before and after critical steps (mkdir, rsync) with timestamps, providing a clearer timeline of execution in the logs.

Enhanced rsync Exclusions: Added common directories like .ipynb_checkpoints, .cache, .conda, .local, and .config to the --exclude list. These directories often contain large amounts of data that don't need to be backed up and can significantly reduce the rsync execution time, potentially preventing timeouts.

Error Handling for rsync: An if statement checks the exit status of rsync to report specific failures.

3. Steps to Apply and Debug the Enhanced LCC
Update LCC: Go back to the SageMaker console, select your sagemaker-user-profile-backup-lcc (or whatever you named it), click Edit, and replace the "Hello World" script content with the "Enhanced EBS to EFS Backup LCC Script" provided above. Save the changes.

Restart JupyterLab: For the LCC changes to take effect, you must stop and then restart the JupyterLab instance associated with the user profile.

From the SageMaker console, go to User profiles.

Select the user profile.

Click Stop JupyterLab. Wait for it to stop.

Once stopped, click Start JupyterLab.

Monitor CloudWatch Logs Closely: This is the most crucial step for debugging.

Go to CloudWatch -> Log groups -> /aws/sagemaker/studio.

Find the log stream corresponding to your user profile (e.g., domain-id/user-profile-name/jupyterlab).

Watch the logs as the instance starts up. You should see the output from your LCC script.

What to Look For in CloudWatch Logs:

Error Messages: Any ERROR: messages from the script itself will indicate a problem with EFS mounting, directory creation, or rsync permissions.

Progress of rsync: The echo statements will show you if rsync started and when it completed. If you see the "Starting rsync operation..." message but not the "rsync operation completed successfully" message, it strongly suggests the rsync command is timing out or getting stuck.

SIGTERM Timing: If SIGTERM appears after rsync has been running for a while, it confirms a timeout. If it appears very early, it might indicate a more fundamental issue before rsync even gets a chance to run.

Common Causes for Failure with rsync in LCCs:

LCC Timeout: The most frequent reason. If the user's EBS volume has a lot of data (especially many small files), rsync can take longer than the LCC timeout allows.

EFS Permissions: The SageMaker execution role and the user profile must have the necessary IAM permissions to write to the EFS file system. Also, the EFS access point (if used) and file system policy must allow the SageMaker user to write to the target directory.

EFS Not Fully Mounted: Sometimes, the EFS might not be fully mounted or accessible at the exact moment the LCC script tries to access it. The checks in the enhanced script help mitigate this.

Insufficient Resources: While less common for rsync itself, if the instance type is very small and the rsync operation is very I/O or CPU intensive, it could indirectly lead to timeouts.

If the timeout persists even with the enhanced script and exclusions, you will need to consider alternative backup strategies as mentioned in the thought process, as LCCs might not be suitable for very large or time-consuming backup operations.
